This is a personal website for myself, created with Jekyll and using the Minimal Mistakes theme.

# Updating Jekyll
Instructions on upgrading jekyll can be found [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/upgrading/).

# Testing Changes
Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` once you have made your changes to regenerate the static site and serve locally. Navigate to localhost:4000 to view the local page.
