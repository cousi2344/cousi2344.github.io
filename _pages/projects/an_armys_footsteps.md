An Army's Foosteps is a final project for HST 251: Doing Digital History, a course I took in Spring 2017 at Michigan State University. The project involves studying the locations of Roman temporary fortifications and encampments in Scotland. The website was designed using Wordpress, and the project involved analysis of geographical data using ArcGIS and comparison of this data with information from historical sources.
