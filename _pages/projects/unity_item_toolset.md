Unity Item Toolset is a work-in-progress set of editor extensions for an item system in the Unity game engine. These extensions were originally started as part of MI 333: Advanced Game Development, which I took at Michigan State University during the Spring 2018 semester.

Unity Item Toolset is available on [Github](https://github.com/cousi2344/UnityItemToolset).
