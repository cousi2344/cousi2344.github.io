[Honors Times Two](https://sites.google.com/site/honorstimestwo/) is a mentoring program run through the Michigan State University Honors College that connects MSU students with gifted elementary school students. I participated in Honors Times Two during the 2016-17 and 2017-18 academic years, during which I mentored two students in basic programming using [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) and Python/[Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news).

See the results of the 2016-2017 mentorship [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/cousin55/) at my Scratch account.
