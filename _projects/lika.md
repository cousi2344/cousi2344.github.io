Lika is a atmospheric side-scrolling game about blowing leaves. Guide your leaves through a magic forest to restore color and balance to the seasons! 

## My Contributions
- Programmed motion system for leaves in player-controlled wind using vector fields
- Maintained vector field code and implemented new features for puzzles and movement
- Developed camera control scripts

## Release
More information on an Android release of Lika is (hopefully) coming soon!

## Team
Developed by a student team in MI 497: Game Design Studio at Michigan State University (Fall 2018).
