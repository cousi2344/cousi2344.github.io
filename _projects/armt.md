title: "Augmented Reality Mechanic Training"
---
Augmented Reality Mechanic Training is a set of immersive virtual training experiences for mechanics. It is built with the Unity Game Engine and includes applications for Windows PCs, Android phones, and the Microsoft HoloLens, all of which are designed to help mechanics familiarize themselves with large, unwieldy, or expensive machinery. Augmented Reality Mechanic Training was developed as part of the MSU Computer Science Capstone Experience and in collaboration with the Union Pacific Corporation.
